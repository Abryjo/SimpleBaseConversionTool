# SimpleBaseConversionTool
A simple (messy) tool for converting numbers between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.
This tool is probably much slower, uglier, and negligent of PEP-8 standards than it should to be. I don't care!
I'm not from a formal programming background, but rather a journalistic one. 
As long as it does what I want it to do, I'm fine breaking some rules and standards.

Based on the following Twitter exercise:
